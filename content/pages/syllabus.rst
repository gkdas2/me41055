Course Description
==================

| ME41055: Multibody Dynamics B
| Faculty of Mechanical, Maritime, and Materials Engineering, Delft University of Technology
| Year: 2021/2022, EC: 4
| Study Guide: https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=59436
|

After the completion of this class you will have developed the skills to model,
interpret, simulate, and analyze `multibody systems`_, i.e. systems which are
made up of interconnected rigid bodies with arbitrary constraints and applied
loads. Mathematical models of multibody systems are typically very useful at
predicting the motion of macro scale objects. `Newton's laws of motion`_ are
the foundation of developing predictive models of these systems. Examples of
systems you will be able to model are: spacecraft trajectories, human/animal
biomechanics, vehicle motion, robot motion, etc.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

Students will be able to:

- formulate a model and free body diagram of multibody systems
- incorporate holonomic and nonholonomic constraints into a multibody system
- derive the nonlinear and linear equations of motion of a multibody system
- simulate the motion of a multibody system with a computer
- interpret and analyze the results of simulation
- understand and explain notable dynamic phenomena

Prerequites
-----------

We highly recommend taking TU Delft's WB2630 Toets 1: Rigid-Body Dynamics prior
to this course. Otherwise any introductory dynamics course will likely suffice.
You should also be proficient with at least one scientific programming
language. You will be learning and using Python_ for the class assignments.

If you haven't had a dynamics course, you can probably get by if you are
motivated and you already know:

- Linear algebra
- Vector calculus
- Calculus based physics
- Introductory numerical methods
- Introductory scientific computing

Time and Location
=================

Lecture videos will be posted online for viewing each Friday, starting February
4, 2022. You will be expected to watch the videos beore the work sessions on
Tuesdays. Homework work sessions will occur each week:

- Quarter 3: Tuesdays 13:45-15:45, 3mE-CZ D (James Watt)
- Quarter 4: Tuesdays 15:45-17:45, 3mE-CZ D (James Watt)

Academic Integrity
==================

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. All assignments turned in for a
grade must be your unique work and the exams should be completed solely by you
with no assistance from others.

Course Text and Materials
=========================

The course will be based primarily on provided lecture notes and computational
materials. These will be provided incrementaly as we proceed through the
course. The primary principles and notation are based on this freely available
book:

   Thomas R. Kane, and David A. Levinson. Dynamics, Theory and Application.
   McGraw Hill, 1985. http://hdl.handle.net/1813/638.

Note that the book is out of print, but you can download a PDF copy from
Cornell's eCommons digital repository for personal use.

Additionally, some topics will be derived from the following books:

- Heike Vallery and Arend L. Schwab, "Advanced Dynamics", 3rd edition, Delft
  University of Technology, 2020, ISBN/EAN 978-90-8309-060-3
- Thomas R. Kane, Peter W. Likins, and David A. Levinson. Spacecraft Dynamics.
  McGraw Hill, 1983. http://hdl.handle.net/1813/637.

Other dynamics resources and references can be found on the resources page.

Software
========

We will be making extensive use of the computer aided algebra software SymPy_
and SciPy_ to model and simulate multibody systems. These packages are written
in the open source Python programming language and leverage the scientific
python ecosystem of scientific and engineering computing tools.  You will have
access to these through XXXX. You may also install the software on your own
computer.  It is recommended that bring your laptop, tablet, or phone to class
to follow along with the interactive sessions (laptop is recommended). See the
`software page`_ on this website for more information.

Assignments & Grades
====================

The average of your best 10 of 12 homeworks will be counted as 60% of the
course grade and the exam will count as 40% of the course grade. If the exam
grade is better than the average homework grade, then the course grade is 100%
exam.

Homework
   There will be 12 computational homework assignments. You may turn in
   homework as a pair or as an indivdual. All homework submissions should be
   the unique work of the pair or individual. When submitting as a pair, you
   must provide a contribution statement explaining the contributions of each
   person to the homework.
Exam
   The exam will be a 3 hour and allow open resources.

Homework grades will be posted to Brightspace throughout the duration of the
course.

Brightspace
===========

We will make use of Brightspace for the course. We will be using several
features in Brightspace:

Announcements
   This will be my primary communication avenue to you. These announcements can
   be forwarded to your TU Delft email address. You are expected to read these
   when shared.
Grades
   Your grades and basic stats on your relative performance will be available
   as the course goes along.
Files
   Copyrighted and private files, documents, and other resources will be
   available here for download. The rest will be available for download on this
   website.

Communication
=============

Slack
   ?
Brightspace Discussions
   This is the first place to ask questions. Use this forum to ask questions
   that are general for the class. Try to restructure your less general
   questions into general ones so you can ask here. This minimizes the number
   of times a question has to be answered and allows both students and
   instructors to collectively answer questions.
