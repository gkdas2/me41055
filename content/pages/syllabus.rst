Course Description
==================

| ME41055: Multibody Dynamics B
| Faculty of Mechanical, Maritime, and Materials Engineering, Delft University of Technology
| Year: 2021/2022, EC: 4
| Study Guide: https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=59436
|

After the completion of this class you will have developed the skills to model,
interpret, simulate, and analyze `multibody systems`_, i.e. systems which are
made up of interconnected rigid bodies with arbitrary constraints and applied
loads. Mathematical models of multibody systems are typically very useful at
predicting the motion of macro scale objects. `Newton's laws of motion`_ are
the foundation of developing predictive models of these systems. Examples of
systems you will be able to model are: spacecraft trajectories, human/animal
biomechanics, vehicle motion, robot motion, etc.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

Students will be able to:

- formulate a model and free body diagram of multibody systems
- incorporate holonomic and nonholonomic constraints into a multibody system
- derive the nonlinear and linear equations of motion of a multibody system
- simulate the motion of a multibody system with a computer
- interpret and analyze the results of simulation
- understand and explain notable dynamic phenomena

Prerequites
-----------

We highly recommend taking TU Delft's WB2630 Toets 1: Rigid-Body Dynamics prior
to this course. Otherwise any introductory undergraduate level dynamics course
should suffice. You should also be proficient with at least one scientific
programming language. You will be learning and using Python_ for the class
assignments.

If you haven't had a dynamics course, you can probably get by if you are
motivated and you already know:

- Linear algebra
- Vector calculus
- Calculus based physics
- Introductory numerical methods
- Introductory scientific computing

Time and Location
=================

Lecture videos will be posted online for viewing each Friday, starting February
4, 2022. You will be expected to watch the videos before the work sessions on
Tuesdays. Homework work sessions will occur each week on Tuesdays:

- Quarter 3: Tuesdays 13:45-15:45, 3mE-CZ D (James Watt) & Online
- Quarter 4: Tuesdays 15:45-17:45, 3mE-CZ D (James Watt) & Online

The current coronavirus regulations permit 75 students in the lecture hall at
one time. If you want to attend in-person, you must self sign up for one of the
75 slots on the groups in Brightspace. All others will have to join via
Microsoft Teams for these sessions.

Academic Integrity
==================

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. All homework assignments turned in
for a grade must be your (or you and your partner's) unique work. You may base
your answers off of external materials, but not your classmate's work. If you
work with a partner on homework you must include a contribution explanation
that explains what each student did.

If you make use of code found in other materials that you did not write
yourself, either directly or in a modified form, you must follow the copyright
licenses associated with that material. If there is no copyright license
present, then you must obtain a written and signed permission from the author
of the materials and provide that with your assignment submission. If there is
a copyright license present (e.g. GPL, MIT, BSD, CC-BY), then you must follow
the terms of that license. Most licenses, at minimum, require you to include
the license with your work submission.

All code and written answers will be checked for plagiarism amongst student
submissions and against external materials. Unattributed plagiarized materials
will be marked with a 0 grade.

Course Text and Materials
=========================

The course will be based primarily on provided lecture notes and computational
materials. These will be provided incrementally as we proceed through the
course. The primary principles and notation are based on this freely available
book:

   Thomas R. Kane, and David A. Levinson. Dynamics, Theory and Application.
   McGraw Hill, 1985. http://hdl.handle.net/1813/638.

Note that the book is out of print, but you can download a PDF copy from
Cornell's eCommons digital repository for personal use.

Additionally, some topics will be derived from the following books:

- Heike Vallery and Arend L. Schwab, "Advanced Dynamics", 3rd edition, Delft
  University of Technology, 2020, ISBN/EAN 978-90-8309-060-3
- Thomas R. Kane, Peter W. Likins, and David A. Levinson. Spacecraft Dynamics.
  McGraw Hill, 1983. http://hdl.handle.net/1813/637.

Software
========

We will be making extensive use of the computer aided algebra software SymPy_
along with NumPy_ and SciPy_ to model and simulate multibody systems. These
packages are written in the open source Python programming language and
leverage the scientific Python ecosystem of scientific and engineering
computing tools. You will have access to these through Vocareum in Brightspace.
You may also install the software on your own computer. It is recommended that
bring your laptop to the work sessions. See the `software page`_ on this
website for more information.

Assignments & Grades
====================

The average of your best 10 of 12 homeworks will be counted for 60% of the
course grade and the exam will count for 40% of the course grade. If the exam
grade is better than the average homework grade or you are taking a resit exam,
then the course grade is 100% exam.

Homework
   There will be 12 computational homework assignments. Homeworks will be made
   available via Brightspace-Vocareum one week before they are due. You may
   turn in homework as a pair or as an individual. All homework submissions
   should be the unique work of the pair or individual. When submitting as a
   pair, you must provide a contribution statement explaining the contributions
   of each person to the homework.
Exam
   The exam will have a 3 hour duration. You will be able to use any resources
   available to you, e.g. books, Jupyter notebooks, websites. Effective use of
   the computational tools taught in class will give you the best chance at
   succeeding, but they are not necessarily required to succeed.

Brightspace
===========

We will be using several features in Brightspace:

Announcements
   This will be the instructor's primary communication avenue to you. These
   announcements can be forwarded to your TU Delft email address. You are
   expected to read these when shared.
Discussions
   All questions for the instructors (or fellow classmates) that are not of a
   private nature should be asked in Brightspace discussions. If you need to
   discuss something of a private nature with the instructor(s), use email.
Grades
   Homework grades will be posted to Brightspace throughout the duration of the
   course.
Groups
   To attend the work sessions in-person, you must sign up for that week's
   group. It is first come, first serve for the 75 open slots.
Vocareum
   You will access the homework Jupyter notebook assignments here. You can edit
   edit and execute the notebooks in the Vocareum interface.
